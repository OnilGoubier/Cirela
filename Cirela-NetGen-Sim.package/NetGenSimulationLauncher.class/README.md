A NetGenSimulationLauncher class is a launcher of a simulation program generated by Netgen, http://wsn.univ-brest.fr/NetGenNews/, in occam.
The results of the launched simulation are animated using Roassal, with an OpenStreetMap as background.

Netgen is used to create a wireless sensor network (WSN), with the geographical position of sensors (lattitude and longitude). Knowing the communication range of sensors, Netgen can compute the communication configuration of sensor networks. Base of this network computation, simulation codes in occam are generated. 

We present some examples working with already available simulation results, so no need of occam compiler and programs:
1. NetGenSimulationLauncher aTriangleExample2
    A very simple example without map background 
2. NetGenSimulationLauncher soundSmartSantanderExample2 
   An example of sound WSN for smart santander, spain
3. NetGenSimulationLauncher  floodJakartaExample
   Simulate a WSN for flood monitoring in Jakarta. 

Instance Variables :
	- streamIn 
	- networkGeometry : aNetworkGeometry
	- timeNodeMessage : aDictionary

streamIn  : temporary store the results of the simulation 

networkGeometry : aNetworkGeometry to store the network configuration 

timeNodeMessage : ADictionary containing time and messages arriving in nodes. Time as key and anOrderedCollection of NetworkNodeMessage instances as value.
