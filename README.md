======

This repository aimes at sharing codes of open source applications to monitor environment, especially natural disasters.

This repository contains 2 packages:
1. Cirela_RTOSM Package consists of the visualization of geographical information using roassal on the openstreetmap as a background.
2. Cirela_NetgenSimulation Package allowing the execution of a synchronised and concurrent WSN simulation program, written in occam, from pharo environment. The results are then animated on a map visualizing the locations of the simulated sensors.
